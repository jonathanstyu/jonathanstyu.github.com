For the past six years I have been working in a number of startups mostly as a marketer and data analyst. My specialty has been Facebook acquisition marketing. I am not sure if I am going to write a lot about my job here, but that's my job description if you are curious. 

In my spare time, I like to write code. I started off writing apps in iOS and Swift. Lately I have been dabbling with JavaScript and Electron desktop apps. You might see me write about this from time to time, mostly in incoherent rants. 

In this blog, I write about the issues and thoughts that come into my life. It started off in 2013 as I was going through a developer boot camp, learning about coding and stuff. One of the exercises that they did was to make you write in a blog every day to explain about what you learned. The habit stuck as time passes. 

I consider this blog a rough sketchpad for the thoughts that I have on a regular basis.
