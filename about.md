This is the first blog that I am going to be starting on in a while. It is also the first one that I am going to be more dedicated towards. I tried Tumblr but did not enjoy it as much. I think this one might stick. 

I am not going to make this blog stick to any particular group or theme. It is just going to be on whatever I wish it to be about. You might see me write about movies, stocks, investment, business, Apple, tech, anime, or life. I write because I do not want to go crazy. This helps.
