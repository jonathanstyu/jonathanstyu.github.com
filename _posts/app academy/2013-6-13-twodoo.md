### TwoDo

TwoDoo - A to-do app that is the project for AA W5D4

Today we had two projects. The first one was an online newspaper web subscription tracker. It would look at a bunch of newspapers and then let you work on making subscriptions and plans. You can set up a bunch of preordered plans that a customer can go and purchase. I find it a little bizarre and peculiar that we would be buying newspapers online but hey this is a project and it was a fun little thing that did not take a long time.

Next was a more extensive program: a To-Do app that would be pretty extensive. It had a set up that looks kind of like this: There are projects, items that are under these projects and these projects belong to teams. The challenge is setting up all these associations.

I never finished the entire to do app because I spent the majority of the time focusing on building and improving the views. In my previous life I spent a lot of time with Bootstrap. In this rails app, I integrated Bootstrap for the first time with a rails app. I had been trying for a long time and just now got this working. With that I could spend time working with making nav bars, modals, and creating tables.
