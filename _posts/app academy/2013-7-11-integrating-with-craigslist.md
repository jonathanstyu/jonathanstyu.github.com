### Creating a form

Rene and I had talked about one of the challenges of creating a rental form collection product would be that when it comes to marketing, there is nothing that beats Craigslist. Craigslist is the end all, be-all when it comes to marketing rentals and trying anything else would be a waste of time. So one of the challenges is that there is no Craigslist API. There is no automated way to put a listing onto Craigslist. So the only way is to do it through human effort. But while it is not possible to do this automatically, we can try to make it as easy as possible. Rene suggested that we would be able to provide HTML templates of the ads. You would pick a Craigslist List template and it would spit out the HTML that you could then just copy and paste right into the entry. This is the major challenge that I was urged to work on today.
