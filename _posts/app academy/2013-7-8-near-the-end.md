### Final Projects

Today some people decided that it would make more sense to continue working on their final projects. Some of these apps that I have seen are really really good. Quite impressive if you ask me. However in my case I decided that I would like to move on and work on a different app. GoodReads is cute but I have been thiking for a long time about a particular app that I think might be good to be looking at. The app that I decided to work on is a rentform app that I think is going to help people collect the forms and help budding land lords collect forms for a particular listing.

The core functionality of this app is going to be the collecting of a form. Simple enough, but this thing is going to be very freaking difficult because there are going to be so many different parts of the form and that they are split up between the different parts of the whole application. There are personal references, employment history, emergency contacts, rent history, and personal information. I am going to spend some time and think about how this should be executed. My thinking right now is to split this up into a whole bunch of different models that are going to be submitted together as a single thing.
