### Word Chains

Today in Day 6 I took the practice assessment that Ned gave us before the actual assessment on Monday. It took me about an hour and 10 minutes to get the whole thing. It worked kind of like the one that I took before I joined Academy for the first place. There were five problems and they were for the most part pretty challenging. I found myself stuck on a few things like blocks. After finishing, I checked the answers and then we did the whole assessment again. This time it's much faster because I learned some tricks from the solutions. I tried to not look at my own code and approach it in new ways.

After that, I spent some time working on the old solutions and we did some of the problems. I've been assigned a project which is to redo the Word Chainer problem that I struggled so much with on Day 3. Back then, I was able to get it to work but the chain was ridiculously long. This time, I hope to apply some of the things that I learned on days four and five so to create a better solution.

I also read up on Git. I tried to follow through some of the tutorials that were provided on the site to me but I do have kind of a weird Mac and its quirks meant that when I tried some of the Git commands, it did not work. That is not going to be some much of an issue going forward because I don't really develop on my personal computer for assignments but I should look into it in the future.

The weekend is a time to relax and spend some time but it is also an opportunity to review and digesting the information I learned in the past. I hope to put in enough work to succeed here.
