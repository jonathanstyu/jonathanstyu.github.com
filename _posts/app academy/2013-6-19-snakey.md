### Snakey

This is going to be a quick post because I have to do some work right now. The homework tonight is to go and write a snake program. The program is going to be first written on the console and then brought over into the web page with the magic of JQuery.

Today in our JQuery projects we added a UI to our Towers of Hanoi and Tic Tac Toe games. I am quickly getting tired of these two games. I wrote them in Ruby. Then wrote them in JS. Now I am writing them in HTML5 and JQuery. Sigh. And the quirks of the program meant that every time I wrote it I had to rewrite it again and again.

The interesting way with how this program is set up is that you can put together a program like this and it seems like magic almost how it all comes together in JavaScript and JQuery. JQuery acts like magic some times - much like Rails - but at heart the instructors were clear to tell us that this was very much something real. There is JS in the heart of that.
