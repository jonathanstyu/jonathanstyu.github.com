I have a friend who likes to go to concerts. Last year she went to the Electronic Dance Conference at Las Vegas and had a blast. Other times she goes to see Britney or Ariana Grande. For a while I did not think much of it but just be glad that she was having a blast. 

After the Las Vegas shootings (and the Ariana Grande bombing too), I told her that I don’t think she should be going to those anymore. 

I know that there are plenty of good people out there. And lots of security around events like these as well as sporting events and the like. But to me anywhere you have a large amount of people is a chance to do some heavy human damage. 

More than just shootings, anywhere there are crowds and crowds of people, we should feel tense. Mass transit and infrastructure. What happens if someone blows themselves up in a BART tunnel under the SF Bay? How much damage will that do to the economy? Every morning rush hour is like a small concert. 

It could have been so much worse. The Las Vegas shooter killed 59 people in 11 minutes of shooting. It took over an hour to find the guy. He innovated a new way to shoot at people - high up from a perch where it would be difficult to find out where he is or shoot back at him without hitting others. 

The newspapers pointed it out and future shooters will take note. The word is out. Any public gathering is a barrel of fish. Concerts? College football games? Political rallies? All game. Think of Staples Center. What’s right next to it? A 54 [story hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Live#Hotels_and_residences). 

They will know that they will need to find the high ground and that they can rack up a high body count without needing to be super accurate as long as you are shooting into a crowd. And they have a lot longer than they might think. So there will be more of these coming. 

They are coming like the seasons, and I think people should cope by just not being there when it happens.
