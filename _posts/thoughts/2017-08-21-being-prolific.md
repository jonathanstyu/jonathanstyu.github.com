I recently shared what I find an impactful article with my sister. She has a passion for drawing and enjoys creating comics. I told her that she should share them on Instagram. Her humor is quite dark - the type of gallows humor that I enjoy and traffick in. But at the same time she is afraid to share her work and that people will hate it. To me, it feels like that is much less likely than just … nobody caring. 

Well that happens, right. But that is how things are. We gotta get used to the idea that we have no idea why things are popular - so that means anything can go viral without you expecting it to be so. It is funny for me. For my own coding videos, I have no idea which topics will be popular. It just so happens to turn out to be. 

Anyway, I [read this article](https://medium.com/amp/p/82d674e56194) a long time ago - but like many articles with deceptively powerful messages this one stayed with me over the ages. I found myself repeatedly mouthing its points to other people. I found myself chanting its mantras during difficult, slow times. As a creative person, you should focus on being as prolific as you can be. Keep making, creating, and pushing it out there. 

I enjoyed the insights and research quoted from the piece, especially that from Professor Dean Simonton:  “On average, creative geniuses aren’t qualitatively better in their fields than their peers, they simply produce a greater volume of work which gives them more variation and a higher chance of originality.”  I am not sure if this is actually verifiably true but it’s immensely heartening to me. 

As I count it right now - I write my blog, video blog, have four small programming side projects in various stages of completion, research cryptocurrency trading, read everything I can get my hands on, look for potential stock investment ideas, and also spend time giving advice on marketing and everything else that I might find myself having a thought on. People often tell me that I do a lot, but I am constantly thinking that I am not doing enough. I want to know that everything I can be doing, I am doing and trying out. 

Just keep doing what you are doing and let the rest handle itself.
