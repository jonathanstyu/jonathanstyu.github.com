I first read this book when I was in high school at the age of 16. I do not remember all that much about the experience except that I was annoyed that I had to "take notes" of the book. I did not like having to write my feelings about the book every few paragraphs. I finished it without incident and then moved on to the other books - but the book's cover became familiar to me. I remember seeing it in the backpacks of countless fellow students of mine. 

The reason I went back to it was when I read [this article](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/06/watership-down/) in the Paris Review. Sometimes it takes a little push or a change of perspective, but at the end of this I decided that I should go back. I picked up the audiobook and went forth. It had been nearly 15 years since I read this book. I was not sure what to expect. 

I have to say that has been one of the most engrossing and engaging reads that I have had this entire year. There is just something about this book that holds together. At the time I was not able to keep up with the narrative. Changing to an audiobook was crucial for changing that. It made much more sense this time and I loved every bit of the story. 

The story turns into a true thriller near the end as the rabbits meet their big antagonist. General Woundwort is not some snarling villain though, he is rendered realistically and with great depth. You understand his perspective, and that makes the entire story that much better. I think for some reason, that sort of thing is missing from today's stories. I'm looking at you, Marvel.

I know that many of my high school peers might hesitate before picking this up again. But I loved this book on the second read and I think everyone should go back to it now that they are older and have a different perspective on life.
