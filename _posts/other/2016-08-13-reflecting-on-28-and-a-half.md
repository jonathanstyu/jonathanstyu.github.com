 I used to write frequently but my pace has fallen a bit. Partly because I am working more on side projects and learning, but also because there has not been much for me to say. It feels like the weeks of 2016 have blended together. Despite not having a steady full time job, there is always something to do. Always something to learn. Always something to achieve.

 July 14th passed without much thought, but I should have taken the time to stop and ponder. A month late is better than nothing, I suppose.

 It would bore me and you the reader to review again in detail the work that I have done with regards to career. But here is a short primer, for future Jonathan many years in the future. In the six months since your 28th, you:

 * Traveled out to Sonora, CA to do freelance marketing for a freelance client. You worked on their FB campaigns and still run them today
 * You still work with True\&Co, helping them with their models and keeping your ties and skills fresh
 * You got a good job offer for digital marketing, but you turned it down
 * You are now working on finding work in development, like you almost did in 2013

 Turning down the job offer, I had to ask myself the question, "Well do you think you're going to find yourself thinking about this choice again in two years?" Regardless of the fear of a technical field, the skepticism of friends, and crippling self-doubt, it's clear that the answer is yes. We live to move forward, and answer for ourselves the tough questions about who we are, our truth as Jenny likes to put it. My truth is that I don't know, and I think it is time to find out.

 Stuff gets tough and it is easy to get discouraged when you are working on your own. I remember how bad it is. So future Jonathan, read this, take a walk and pitter patter around, take a nice nap, and get back to it the next day.
