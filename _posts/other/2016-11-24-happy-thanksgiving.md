I am sitting in a Starbucks on Thanksgiving morning and spending a little time to write some thoughts. Over the past few days, I have had the opportunity to meet with many friends and coworkers. Though there was no need for a reminder, I cannot help but recall that home consists of the people around us. 

We are privileged to live in a generous, kind (at times) society filled with people of all types. You cannot ever appreciate them enough. 

Happy bird day, everyone.
