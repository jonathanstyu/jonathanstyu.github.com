I have been working on a brand new app, one focused on helping people get a job. One of the challenges that I have struggled with for apps is how to get ahold of visual assets, especially for the assets on the intro screen that pops up when someone first opens the app (like a tutorial). For Jump Shot 2, I used a crappy set of Basketball PNGs and just rotated them in a sequence. I wanted to take it up a notch this time. 

Enter my little sister, Olivia. I asked her for a series of job related cartoons with a bit of humor. She asked me if it was okay if she used animals instead of humans because using people would be too close to reality and be depressing. I said sure. She's hilarious. 

She is also shy and doesn't like to publicize her work, but I thought what came out was so awesome that I had to share it here with you guys.
