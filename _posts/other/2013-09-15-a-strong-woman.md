I read the writing of an acquaintance, someone I knew way back when. He is a good writer, but crafts an image of himself that I find to be rather ridiculous. Like "The Most Interesting Person in the World" kind of image. In one piece, he wrote about his admiration for "strong women". I offered this phrase and premise up to a friend of mine, who replied with my exact thoughts on the matter but funnier. 

"What does that even mean? What is a strong woman?"

"I am not sure. Perhaps he means something like a woman who has a strong disposition."

"Eh?"

"Like living through adversity."

"That's ridiculous. How about a woman who falls off a 30 story building and breaks her both legs and her back? And then she has to recover herself in the hospital. She has to heal and learn how to walk again. How strong of her! Oh and when her legs heal they will be stronger too. Oh my God, it makes perfect sense! She really will be strong!"

Obviously my friend was being facetious but it got me thinking. And then later on I read an interesting article about [male authors writing female characters](http://thehairpin.com/2013/09/when-a-man-writes-a-woman). What was interesting to me was the implication that a male author had difficulty to create a female character because they too often are unable to see women as being outside or even straddling across the established tropes that has permeated through society (the article's aforementioned four tropes: Virgin, whore, mother, bitch). I wonder if this is this might apply to the world beyond the page as well. Is the concept of a "strong woman" in of itself a smokescreen that men who want to be cool and insightful and "beyond appearances" tell their friends they want to be with so that they can appear to be cool and insightful and "beyond appearances"?

I let my imagination go wild and tried to imagine all the tropes that have been gathered together around the phrase of a "strong woman". A strong woman might ... 

* Suffer innocently at the hands of a cruel, hateful man who she has to stay with because otherwise her children would be hurt 

* Suffer quietly and with a strong upper lip because that is what women do. They do not whine or they do not cry

* Be peculiarly quirky in a charming way, with some sort of weird - but not too weird, because that would just be wrong - trait that makes her attractive. She might randomly stop at the middle of the sidewalk so that she can "count the stars in the sky" just because she likes to remember the number of stars in the skies she has walked under or something

* She might be abrasive or angry at first but in reality her heart is golden deep down inside. She just needed to find the right person to uncover it 

* Might not ever fall in love because she is so busy taking care of kittens and orphans in a bad part of town ... 

* But if she did fall in love, she would pursue a pure, thoughtful love with someone she feels her soulmate. But they can never be together because fate - or society - does not allow for it. 

I can go on and on. A lot of these tropes are things that just live in the movies and books. For many people like us - just regular people raised and living in the suburbs with decent jobs and no adventurous life - what a "strong woman" might mean - and what I suspect that my acquaintance might be having in mind - is a female who is smart, not shallow, and outspoken. 

I think what bothers me most about the use of that word is that using the word "strong" attributes something to someone who probably does not have it. I do not think a person who is smart, not shallow, and outspoken can be automatically then be called "strong". In fact, I believe that everyone is weak. It is the guilty Catholic inside me. Based on my own experiences watching other people - friends and family - struggle through their lives as well as me struggling through my own, I slowly have come to believe that we are all weak and feeble people at heart. People say and believe things that are ideal and are abstract like marriage, fidelity, and diets for example. At the time they deeply believe in what they are doing and the reasons for which they do it. But several months later, you see in the news or through the grapevine that that person has broken against that covenant. They fell short. The reason they fell short is because they are weak.

When we believe that someone else is strong, we start depending on them. It will feel good for you, because you can suddenly rely on someone as your tower and edifice. They are always there for you and their example is something you can strive for. I have someone who I depend on. I might even label them as being "strong". When I ponder over something that I might do or can do, I can hear my own voice saying to me that my dependent, my tower, would never do it that way. That they would never be as weak as I just was. My cognitive dissonance is such that I rely on this person so much yet at the same time, I know that they are just like me. They are weak and they have their own bits and parts about them that makes them not so great as I idealize in my head. 

So far, I have judged that it is okay to maintain this conflict between reality and the abstract. It is a reality that I refuse to face or acknowledge. I know that it would hurt my own conduct from day to day. It would destroy my moral compass and direction in life. Yet at the same time, I value truth and honesty in all my life and relationships. Can I be honest with other people if I have instances of falsity and, perhaps worse, deliberate illusions? It is certainly not the mark of a strong person. Then again, it proves my point that we are all at heart weak. 

Who knows whether or not everything I just spoke about actually applies to my acquiantance's experiences or beliefs. More likely it is not than it actually is. Hell, I long ago left behind the point and topic of this article, spiraling into tendril and tangent. But I enjoyed spending the time thinking about what it means to be a strong person and the exploring the implications. I do consider myself someone who is more apart from others. I prefer to be on my own a lot. However, there are times when such behavior had - has - led me to believe that I do not need any other people in my life period. My desire for solitude has - to use the notation I am using in the above post - made me believe that I am "strong". I am in fact not. The world has shown that to me many times over. No matter who I am, how smart I get, how rich I get I will always be a weak person. And that is fine, because we are all like that. Weak, petty, stupid animals with pointless desires and pinecone instincts. Only by realizing that and embracing it are we able to become just a tiny bit slightly infinitesimally better.
