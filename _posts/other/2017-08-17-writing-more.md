I read a [great article](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/why-everyone-should-write/) by Collaborative Fund, a VC firm, that asks us all to spend more time writing. I have also been speaking to my friend Dan about writing more. I urge him to write more, but when I look back at what I am doing from day to day I am not finding all that much of my own time being spent on writing. But for the most part, my writing is done at the time that I can find at coffee shops during the weekend mornings. 

I really do enjoy those mornings, but lately those mornings have been taken up by new coding projects. Nothing serious - just exploration and stretching old muscles that have atrophied over time. This means that I need to carve out some time to write again. 

Writing is important to me - and that is not just because I used to make money from it. That is because my brain often tends to tumble the same ideas over again and again ad nauseum until I take the time to put them down onto (digital) paper. It is like as if I need to unload them there. Only once that I have published then I can start moving on. 

When I was in high school, my first hours during each day in the summer vacation would be spent on writing. I turned on some Beethoven or Mozart and wrote on whatever I was writing on at the time. Most mornings nowadays, I spend reviewing emails and news from the States. I often find those early hours very productive - but in a sort of unproductive way. I realize that I am starting my day in a jumble. That is not fun, it feels like I am being catapulted into an already-hectic day by a SpaceX rocket. 

Changing your everyday processes is always tough and I am no exception but I feel like maybe it might make long-term sense to sacrifice the productivity for now. What will I be writing? Anything, really. One of the things that I found most interesting from the article is the statement that writers do not know what will they end up writing until they actually start it. My last post was this exact case. I started up with something totally different but it eventually evolved into something that read sort of like an advice post.

Letâ€™s see where it goes.
