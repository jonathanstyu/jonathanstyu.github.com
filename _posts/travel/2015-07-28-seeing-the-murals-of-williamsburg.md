This past weekend I was in New York City for the first time where I stayed for longer than a single day. My host Dan was so psyched about the visit that he rented a car. I was regretful at first, but it turned out to be a great idea because we got to see more sights than I could have if I were just on foot. 

One of my favorites experiences was driving through East Williamsburg and glancing upon a number of provocative murals. Stunning works of art, I would like to present a few of my favorite here.

I have a longer post coming up with more about my trip to NYC but right now I just wanted to share these with you while my memory remains fresh.
