<p>
	SEC Research is a limited-feature iPad app that lets you easily access and read a company's SEC filings from the SEC website. An SEC filing is a report that a publicly held company (like Apple or Google) submits to the US Government about itself, its business conditions and its financial status. This information is then made publicly available by the US Government. Hedge fund managers and small investors alike use the information found in these filings to make investing decisions.

	<h3>The Stream</h3>
	<img src='https://raw.github.com/jonathanstyu/jonathanstyu.github.com/master/images/stream.png'>
	<p>
		SEC Research's Stream feature lets you peruse filings that have just been posted to the SEC's website. You can peruse them, see a bit more about the company's details, and then see the filing itself. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Searching Companies</h3>
	<img src='https://raw.github.com/jonathanstyu/jonathanstyu.github.com/master/images/search3.png'>
	<p>
		SEC Research has a search feature that lets someone look up a company by its ticker or CIK number. This would let you access a feed of the company's latest 40 filings. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Favoriting Filings</h3>
	<img src='https://raw.github.com/jonathanstyu/jonathanstyu.github.com/master/images/saved_filing.png'>
	<p>
		If you want to read a filing for later, you can do that by favoriting a filing by touching the button on the top right.

<h1><a name="why-i-built" class="anchor" href="#why-i-built"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why I Built SEC Research</h1>
	<h3>Because I Want to Use It Myself</h3>
	<p>
		I have an iPad Mini and use it all the time for reading books, manga, and more. I enjoy the reading experience so much because I love how light the device is (though it would be nice to have a retina iPad Mini too). However there is one relatively rich source of reading material that is closed off to me and that is the SEC website. Going to the site is like going back to the 90s. It has a search feature but it is tough to hen peck your way through the page.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no real alternative to finding these filings. You can go to the website of the company itself but those websites might have Flash on them or they might be linking you to the crappy glossy reports that are huge PDFs. I want to read just a HTML and text. 
	</p>
	<h3>Because Alternatives Suck</h3>
	<p>
		All of this would not be so much of a pain if it were not for the fact that the only other alternative iPad app for reading SEC filings is a big monstrosity of an app that charges over $8. I cannot complain. Someone has to eat right? Well, I do take issue with the fact that someone would charge $10 for an app that lets you download just the annual report and then $4 for the quarterly reports. These are similar reports. Someone should just put them together in one app.

		<h3>RubyMotion</h3>
		<p>
			I used RubyMotion to build this application, working off the experience I gained while building two earlier applications. The first was a joke iPad App that muxed up a person's emails to be garbled. I called it "Bad Boss Email." After that, I made an app called JumpShot, which was an app for tracking scores in basketball games. I wanted an app that did a better job than just plain paper to track basketball scores in the games that I played late at night. I wanted an app so I went and built it. This is the same situation. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Using Gems</h3>
		<p>
			I found a SEC Query Ruby Gem that would be cool to use. Unfortunately I could not use it because of the way that RubyMotion uses normal "non-RM-aware" gems. There are certain dependencies that just do not work on Objective C, the most vital of which is Hpricot, which is something that the gem needs to go through the HTML code returned by a query. (Yes, no JSON API. You literally have to parse HTML.) I ended up ripping out what I could salvage (which was ultimately very little) and using that. Motion Bundler claims to be able to let you use Ruby gems in RM apps. I have yet to come across a real Ruby Gem in the wild that MotionBundler actually lets you use.
		</p>
		<p>
			The gems I ended up using are RubyMotion exclusive gems: 
			<ul>
				<li>SugarCube</li>
				<li>BubbleWrap (to make the HTTP calls)</li>
				<li>GeoMotion (to help programmatically build the cells)</li>
				<li>HppleMotion (the best Nokogiri replacement I could find)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
